What does a western look like?

Fascinating and beautiful piece

Also fascinating - it's published by "outtake". A somewhat faceless entity on Medium. Is this content paid for by Medium? Somewhat unclear.

Also on medium - brand operating as publishers a prescient take by the Guardian in 2004

*PS - I'm trying something new with the title format, instead of "links week 19th April" I'm going to start writing emoji descriptions. I hope that's ok. I mean it should be, it's my site and I can do what I want right? But, as always if you have comments or feedback drop me a note.
