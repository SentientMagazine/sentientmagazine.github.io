Here's what I'm working on right now:

 - Running an <a href="http://www.fiercelycurious.com">art business</a> - we have an art show opening Oct 23rd! <a href="http://technologyashands.com">technologyashands.com</a>
 - At the early stages of sketching out a new venture - a science fiction publishing company. Codename <a href="http://www.sentientscifi.com">Sentient</a>. Interested? Shoot me a note.
 
I'm pretty busy through the end of the year but at the start of 2016 I'm going to have some availability.
 
In the past I've done a lot of conference speaking - I'm open to new speaking opportunities so get in touch if you have an event you'd like me to speak at.
