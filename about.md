title: About Me
---

Hi there! I'll tell you a little about me. Won't you tell me a little about you?

I've spent my life curious about technology, art, games, people, writing and mathematics. Somewhere in a 4-dimensional intersection of those things I've arrived at where I am today.

And where is that? Brooklyn. Ha! No, but seriously I'm living in Brooklyn, NY and currently spending my time between two projects.

I'm building a small marketing & innovation consulting agency. I've been working in technology, product and marketing for a decade and have worked with and for companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, The New York Times, Hipmunk and more.

Looking to chat about a project? Email me here: [tjcritchlow@gmail.com](mailto:tjcritchlow@gmail.com)

Playing in the intersection between art, design, technology, offline and online I'm building a local business helping Brooklyn-based artists and makers sell their product:

Just get in touch. I'm always happy to meet for coffee.

I'm currently working out of [The Works](http://www.thisistheworks.com/) in Carroll Gardens.

Much love.
